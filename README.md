 ## To Dos
 These are features that we are hoping to add in the application.

 ### 1. Displaying available routes from an origin to a destination.
 * When a user decides to have a ride from a certain place to the other, we will display to him all the availavbel routes he can use to reach his destination.
 * He will have an opportunity to decide the route he prefers.
### 2. Displaying traffic conditions to the user
* For convenience we'd want to utilise all the powers of the Google places API, display to them the current road conditions they are using.
